# sample-public-repo
**Description**: This is a public repo containing samples of code, intended primarily for sharing with potential future collaborators.


### Folder: climate_tweet_LDA

**Description**: Python scripts developed for topic modeling of Twitter posts by down-ballot political candidates during the 2020 election cycle. This can be run out of the box with the `lda_set_and_run.py script`, which will run a Latent Dirichlet Machine topic model and perform logistic regressions for all topics found using example predictors. These scripts and sample data are a small example from ongoing academic research into candidate issue messaging. Additional sample of statistics in the `__name__ == '__main__'` code block of `lda_processing_results.py`.

**Demonstrates**: machine learning models, regression models, exploratory statistics, text-to-data/content analysis, data gymnastics.

**Package requirements**: `gensim == 4.0.1` and `statsmodels == 0.12.2` are required packages that may not already be installed on the typical Python workstation.

**Future updates**: Will provide a more thorough analysis from real data with a dummy political issue (e.g., coffee, puppies), rather than investigating for climate here, where pre-publication data protections are necessary.


### Folder: dashboard_data_mgmt

**Description**: A pipeline of Python scripts developed as a practical approach to clean and merge data lacking common ID system. Applied for periodic data upload to Google Sheets during a fast-paced 2020 election cycle collaboration. 

**Demonstrates**: Data processing (cleaning, transforming, merging) and automated uploading via API.


### *Repo Under Construction*
More example code will continue to be added over time and can be shared bilaterally on request.
